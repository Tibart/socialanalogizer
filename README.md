# Social Analogizer

The idea is that this program scans documents for keyword that correspond to other documents. 
Starting point is that a user has a profile page with a personal story where likes, interests and experiences shared.
Assumption is that every like, interest of experience has a unique word, name or specific phrase, e.g. 'tennis', 'reading', 'KPMG', 'Technical Consultant', etc
